# Instructions
Open terminal (Ctrl + ñ).

Connect android phone to computer.

Configure your phone to be in developer mode. USB debugging ON, Install via USB ON, USB debugging (Security Settings ON): https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options

```bash
npm start
```
In the Metro terminal press "a"
```bash
a - run on Android
```
This takes 2-3 min. Your app should open automatically on the phone. You should be able to see the console.logs of the app on the terminal.

Modify App.js and trackPlayerServices.js

## Release
$ react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/

$ cd android
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug

Then copy file from app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk to your phone
Remember that trackPlayer.ts needs to be modified

# Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!


## Release
# Working method for release
$ react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/

$ cd android
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug

Then copy file from app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk to your phone

# This worked once and later it did not work
$ npx react-native build-android --mode=release
$ npm run android -- --mode="release"
